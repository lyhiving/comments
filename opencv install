I had the same problem you are trying to compile with CUDA8:

try this: in graphcuts.cpp (where your error is thrown) change this:

#include "precomp.hpp"

#if !defined (HAVE_CUDA) || defined (CUDA_DISABLER)
to this:

#include "precomp.hpp"

#if !defined (HAVE_CUDA) || defined (CUDA_DISABLER)  || (CUDART_VERSION >= 8000)
because graphcuts is not supported directly with CUDA8 anymore.
